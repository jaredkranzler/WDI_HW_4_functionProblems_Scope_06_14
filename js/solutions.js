// What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
a parameter is a variable, an argument is the data 
you pass through that parameter. 
a Parameter is the variable being declared by a function, 
where an argument is the actual value of the variable.

// Within a function, what is the difference between 
// return and console.log?
console log prints the language. return actually 
returns values from a function.
